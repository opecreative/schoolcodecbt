1 - CREATE FILE image.php and paste code:

<?php
//Check if we are getting the image
if(isset($_FILES['image'])){
        //Get the image array of details
        $img = $_FILES['image'];       
        //The new path of the uploaded image, rand is just used for the sake of it
        $path = "upload/" . rand().$img["name"];
        //Move the file to our new path
        move_uploaded_file($img['tmp_name'],$path);
        //Get image info, reuiqred to biuld the JSON object
        $data = getimagesize($path);
        //The direct link to the uploaded image, this might varyu depending on your script location    
        $link = "http://$_SERVER[HTTP_HOST]"."/nicedit/".$path;
        //Here we are constructing the JSON Object
        $res = array("upload" => array(
                                "links" => array("original" => $link),
                                "image" => array("width" => $data[0],
                                                 "height" => $data[1]
                                                )                              
                    ));
        //echo out the response :)
        echo json_encode($res);


2 - Open and edit nickedit.js:

Find the line starting like nicURI:"http://api.imgur.com/2/upload.json" 
Replace it with

nicURI:"image.php"


DONE ! Now try uploading something and it would go directly to your server :)
